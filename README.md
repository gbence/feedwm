# feedwm

feedwm is a dwm status bar filling application, very similar to
[dwmstatus](http://dwm.suckless.org/dwmstatus/).  Its primary purpose is to be
a bridge between dwm's xsetroot-based status bar and my elderly evolving Ruby
script, hence the Ruby bindings.

## Installation

Clone, autoconf, configure, make, install, run.

Check the [`examples`](https://github.com/gbence/feedwm/tree/master/examples)
directory for loadable Ruby scripts.
